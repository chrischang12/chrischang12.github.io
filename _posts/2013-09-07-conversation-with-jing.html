<p>About a week ago, I met a fellow programmer at a SF Ruby MeetUp. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised with all my experiences at these types of events in the city. Despite the general stereotypes surrounding computer science, the proliferation of coding has been embraced by (SF/SV) mainstream culture. I digress, but it's worth mentioning. If you're a programmer, or simply curious, and in San Francisco, you should definitely check them out.</p>
<p>Jing, like myself, is a Mission alum- but from '98. He grew up going to Chinese school, studied EECS at UC Berkeley, and worked for a big tech company out of college. In other words, he led a relatively cookie cutter Asian American lifestyle. I spoke to him briefly at the MeetUp, and later listened to his story as we hopped on BART together, headed to Fremont. His story progressively became more and more interesting.</p>
<p>After doing a stint with the big company, he realized he didn't enjoy programming anymore (or in that capacity, at least). He ended up traveling the world, and years later is now running hotels in Bali, Indonesia. He told tales of his adventures in SudaAmerica and London, and I felt rejuvinated just by listening to his stories. I couldn't help but wonder though, what was he doing back in his hometown, back in the United States?</p>
<p>As an intensely introspective millennial, I can generally guess another millennial's aspirations based on their socioeconomic background and a five minute conversation. For the most part, we're a generation of explorers. Exploring the merits of existentialism, inter-connectedness, wealth and adventure. Despite being told by our older friends and family the best practices for making it in the 21st century, we need to find the answer for ourselves.</p>
<p>This point is significant because so often when talking to new graduates, you'll hear them weighing multiple opportunities e.g. backpacking Europe vs. getting a jump start on their career. It's as if we have dramatically mutually exclusive goals, and we haven't figured out how to tackle both simultaneously just quite yet.</p>
<p>And so, here was Jing with his tantalizing life story. Yet, he had come back (temporarily, potentially permanently) home. When asked about his current whereabouts, he compared his neural processes to that of a salmon's. "You naturally swim back to where you were born".</p>
<p>Jing had returned to try to find a job in San Francisco; ideally, he is seeking a tech job that would allow him to work in Bali while providing financial stability for his family.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the fact that he traveled halfway around the world to find a job, or maybe it's because I'm moving there tomorrow, but I finally understood the intense reverence for San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Sure, you can debate the sociopolitical state of SF, but what is undisputed is the simple, observable fact that we are relentless pioneers that are shaping the world.</p>
<p>I throughly enjoyed my chat with Jing. He had a warmth about him that can only be acquired by learning to be a stranger and embracing friendship in all forms. Hopefully I'll see him on the streets of San Francisco; he'll likely be coding from Bali though, living the millennial dream.</p>
