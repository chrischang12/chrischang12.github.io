<p>My first week in - and by in, I mean commuting to- San Francisco and at MongoLab is officially in the books!  It's been fun starting the post grad life. Highlights include spending hours on hours searching for housing on Craigslist (it's pretty much impossible right now),  and my first three days at work.</p>

Yes, that is a V-neck.[/caption]</p>
<p>Work, if you can even call it that, is awesome.  I know it's still early, but it's a good sign when you walk into the office and feel refreshed and alive.  I'm employee #12, so we're a small little family (we're <a title="come work with us!" href="https://mongolab.com/company/">hiring</a>!).  The "productive" banter on Skype always keeps things interesting, but what really makes MongoLab a special place is my fellow comrades' passion for what they do.</p>
<p>Startup culture is fascinating.  I'm probably the youngest working there by at least a handful of years.  Some of them have even started families.  So, what blows me away is how relentless they are in making a better experience for our users.  They're up at all hours hacking away or answering support tickets because they understand that they've made a commitment - users have entrusted their business to us.  MongoLab received funding back in 2011; it has been more than two years since they embarked on this journey, and they're not slowing down.</p>
<p>But enough about that spiel, that's the stuff in the magical Cloud, the stuff you don't see.  What you DO see, is the result of their passion and innovation. Back when I was interviewing, a big highlight that I thought truly reflected their genuine intentions is the fact that they're a for-profit startup making open source software and tools.  For those familiar with DB programming, you know the implications of having no or shoddy indexes.  <a title="pew pew!" href="http://mongolab.org/dex/">Dex</a> is a tool conjured by a trench coat wearing, overall sporting, Legolas-esque haired hacker that analyzes your DB and logs and suggests indexes. It's almost as cool as the guy who wrote it.  For those experimenting with MongoLab and MongoDB on the admin side, we have <a title="&quot;mongocuttle&quot;" href="http://mongolab.org/mongoctl/">mongoctl</a> - written by a soccer fanatic who spends all his time on <a title="kindling fires" href="http://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a>- which allows users to set up and run commands on servers and clusters.  We use these tools at work when helping users, and it's free for anyone to use.</p>
<p>I'm excited to be a part of the MongoLab family, and even more excited for what is coming up next. I have a few cool ideas :) Stay tuned!</p>
