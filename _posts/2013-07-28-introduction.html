<p>It is around 7 PM in San Diego, CA when a young group of college students enter a restaurant. Chris is a quirky first generation Asian American techie studying Computer Science. Like many people his age, he’s seen to be deliberating many tough decisions and concepts, ranging from future opportunities to the meaning of life- he finds the latter a bit more perplexing. As the latecomers of the group slowly trickle in, Chris realizes that he’s beginning to get very, very hungry. Running five to six miles almost every day is perhaps not the best idea on a busy programmer’s schedule. Nonetheless, he is patient with the group, offering suggestions when others struggle with everything looking good, or not knowing what to get. He’s a solution man, who has published an Android app, tinkers with new technologies and languages, scrapes the web with Python, and genuinely enjoys helping others. He is also pragmatic and pensive, and decides to order the braised meat with vegetables. After all, who has time to braise in college?</p>
<p>When food arrives, Chris looks around and waits until everyone receives his or her order before he digs in. The quiet lull as feasting begins only lasts shortly as the table begins discussing graduate schools, job offers, and plans after college. The spotlight progresses and eventually lands on Chris. The typical questions begin. This past summer, he spent his time as a sales intern with VMware, a Fortune 500 software company in Austin, TX. He was successful, evidenced by receiving an offer to return and generating $379,363 in net new opportunities. He was proud that during his time there he also completed three certifications, one of which many the full-time employees had yet to achieve. His friends nodded and smiled with understanding- they too, are overachievers fueled by competition and tangible success. Chris finishes his bit with an observation about teamwork- that he could not have done well if not for his assigned mentor and fellow interns, and that he evangelized his work, unasked by anyone, by creating a binder full of resources and strategies based on his experiences for the future classes of interns to employ.</p>
<p>One sharp individual remarks that Chris has spoken only of the past, and not of the future. Chris grins, visibly excited. His future is much less convoluted than it was a year or even a few months ago. Despite his joyous time in Austin and enjoyment of an awesome lifestyle working in high-tech sales, he found himself too far removed from the business. He wants to make a big impact. He wants to wake up challenged and excited to work every day. As a result of this personal revelation, he has gravitated back to his Computer Science background, allowing him to exercise his creativity while producing tangible tools and code that can be utilized by others. More specifically, he’s intrigued and motivated by a desire to combine both his inter-personal charm and empathy with his technical mind- also known in the Silicon Valley as “growth hacking”.</p>
<p>When the spotlight moves to his right, Chris contemplates how lucky he is to have put himself in a position to succeed. He is twenty-two years of age, armed with experiences on both sides of the business in an industry that he is fascinated by.He relishes the moment, feeling empowered by his purpose: to surround himself with others in the constant pursuit of learning, growing, and hacking.</p>
<p>Dinner ends, and the goodbyes begin. Chris makes sure he gets to the door first- he was raised to be a gentleman.</p>
