<blockquote><p>If you're drowning and I throw you a life jacket would you grab it? Yes! Good. Pick up 200 shares I won't let you down.</p></blockquote>
<p>In sales, you strive to "always be closing". For salespeople looking to "ABC", one common and easy strategy to quickly close (a deal) is to figure out what internal incentive (read: discount) policies are in place and offer that to the prospective customer. Discounts help to shorten the sales cycle, make the buyer feel as if they got a good deal, and may undercut competing products' prices.</p>
<p>While the above sales/pricing strategy can work for large enterprise, startups should avoid discounts.</p>
<p>First, if you find the need to constantly give out discounts or are thinking to create a discount plan, you may want to consider simply lowering prices. This allows for more transparency between your business and your current and prospective customers.</p>
<p>Second, in a world where these incentive policies are in place, company X has likely invested in a few Harvard MBAs to model out all the possible scenarios. They've carefully thought through acceptable margin thresholds and have empirical data on customer spending. In other words, while you and your team are busy building your product, company X likely has an internal organization as big as your team focused solely on pricing.</p>
<p>Third, discounts most likely result in custom work for the marketing, sales, and finance teams. Custom doesn't scale. A friend at Box said it best while talking about custom product needs (which can be extended to pricing and packaging):</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the most important thing is that companies all want to feel special and have their own specific features and requirements but in the end if you end up building one offs for every customer you're gonna end up with a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Gotta reduce customer needs to their fundamentals and see past what they say to what they need and integrate that as a cohesive part of the whole product.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p4">Finally, the best customers are the quiet ones. These customers contact you when they need help or have legitimate questions, understand and appreciate your value prop, have the means to pay for your product(s), and are busy growing their own business (which likely means increasing their monthly spend with you). These customers allow you and your team to focus on the roadmap and improve customer experience for all customers across the board.</p>
