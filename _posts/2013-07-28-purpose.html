<p>Written about a month ago, from another blog:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other night I wasn’t able to fall asleep. So, like a typical Computer Science major in college I decided that the wisest thing to do was open up my laptop and browse the internet. For those curious, I ended up sleeping 2 hours before I awoke for class. I’m glad, however, that I forewent precious sleep because I ended up stumbling on a great article on allthingsd regarding Elon Musk’s <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130529/elon-musks-plea-to-internet-entrepreneurs-do-something-different">interview</a>. Read it, it’s short.</p>
<p>This message supports a growing trend that I’ve begun to see circulating the web. For example, this New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/silicon-valley-start-ups-and-the-end-of-stanford.html">article</a> hits it on the head. The biggest takeaway is that I agree with Nicholas, in that college should be a time for “drifting, thinking, reading, meeting new people, and working on whatever inspires you”. We’re all in our early 20s, for God’s sake. How many people look back on this time and think they’re the same person- even just a couple years after the fact? For a short while, I was caught up in it as well- luckily my laziness trumped half-hearted desire. I was always (frantically) thinking of the next great business idea, trying to figure out what website or service to start because I kept reading on TechCrunch about new startups receiving millions of dollars. It became a race to come out with some new novelty first. More recently, I’ve been enjoying what’s left of my college experience, spending time with friends, experiencing joys and heartbreak, and I absolutely think I am doing it right.</p>
<p>But, to each their own. The real issue that’s troubling is that I’m beginning to see VCs quick to pull out their checkbooks if startups hit the right criteria: good pedigree, mobile, social. To just throw a few notable apps out there: Instagram, Snapchat, Mailbox, Uber. There are more out there, but these apps epitomize the dangerous landscape that is significantly impacting the way that college students live their lives along with what constitutes as “valuable”.</p>
<p>With so much media exposure and money following these apps, it’s no wonder that kids like me dream of making it big and becoming overnight multi-millionaires. But when you take a step back and really examine the number of hours spent by capable techies on these projects (which, objectively, aren’t really life-changing), you begin to realize that there is a lot of wasted potential to do some good in this world, or in communities that need it. Make significant change.</p>
<p>I understand that the Computer Science community is very, very generous and welcoming to others. I take pride in this fact, and encourage my and future generations to take it a step further and work on projects, or dedicate our lives to problems worth solving. As much as I’d like an app that sorts my e-mails in a pretty way when I start working (we have that now, actually), I would much rather see that college CS majors prioritize the importance of philanthropic work.</p>
