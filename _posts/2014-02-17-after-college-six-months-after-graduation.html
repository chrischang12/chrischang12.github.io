<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">I believe, based on personal experience/friends, that the baseline salary now for a good Software Engineer is ~$100,000 straight out of college. This is significant for a couple reasons.</span></p>
<p>1. If you're looking to quickly become financially independent or need to pay off loans after college, Computer Science is a pretty lucrative field with a lot of demand.</p>
<p>2. If you're like me and happened to graduate with a Computer Science degree without truly enjoying/loving programming, it's hard to make a career switch. The money is <em>really</em> good, especially after living below the poverty line for four years.</p>
<p>As a result, there may be growing uncertainty about a chosen career path. I'm happy I made the switch while still leveraging my degree. My only criteria was to be around smart people. After talking with some good friends both in Corp America and not (yet), I've boiled down my experience to a few key elements. Sixth months after college.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">1. Uncertainty is normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Once you start working, a lot of questions will be answered. When you're an undergrad, you might be unsure if you'll like industry software engineering. Or sales, or technical marketing... WTF is technical marketing, really?  What you enjoy doing becomes very apparent when you spend all day and night working and prioritizing your obligations. The best, most recent takeaway I had from a conversation with my CEO Will is that you should always be finding questions you want answers to. Many times, answers come to us before we're even ready for them. For example, I'm sure my undergrad marketing classes would have resonated with me a lot more if I had already gotten my feet wet as a "marketing guy". If given the opportunity to go back, I'd have plenty of questions for guest speakers. What avenue of marketing was most effective for your company and why? What metrics did you define for campaigns and how did you arrive at these measurements/goals? At a higher level, the questions you formulate should</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> help guide your career and choices.</span></p>
<p>2. Good mentors &amp; friend(s).</p>
<p>I greatly admire our executive team and have found a mentor for every aspect of the business- from raising capital to engineering to thinking strategically. Working at a small company allows for frequent dialogue with the top dogs, which should inspire you to keep cranking. Choose your friends wisely- I look up to my best friend and vice versa, which keeps my motor going. It's not weird to put in extra hours or work on the weekends when your friends are doing it too.</p>
<p>3. Ownership.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest reason why my friend and I have a hard time doing anything other than work is because we genuinely feel lucky to be given the responsibilities we have. When you're given ownership over a project or part of the business, every second you put in results in incremental progress and feels 10x better. You are your own barrier to success. When you're employee #5302 it's hard to feel the same motivation.</p>
