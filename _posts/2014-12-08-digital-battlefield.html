<p>"Software is eating the world" and will continue to do so. That's why the battlefields for survival will shift from physical to digital. As a result, people will have to train themselves in the true universal language- programming languages. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Net net, the more people who know how to program (even just the basics!) the better. Programming equates to problem solving. Software programs are not unlike puzzles in that you think through different scenarios and trade-offs and apply the proper action for your situation.</p>
<p>Before people can write programs however, they must first learn how to program. This step is where the true value, regardless if you become a programmer by trade or not, comes in. By learning to program, you must learn to think critically, rationally, and with applied consequence. Inevitably, you will be shaped by the process of learning that you otherwise may not have had to undergo. More people learning to think critically- this is one of the big victories for software.</p>
